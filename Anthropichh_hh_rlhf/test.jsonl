{"chosen": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: To be honest, I don’t know anything about that. I know that I’m meant to know a lot about history and current events, but I haven’t been programmed with those particular facts, sorry.", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?\n\nAssistant: I know that the American Indians were the first to celebrate the first thanksgiving, and the first European settlers came to New England in the early 1600s, and it is likely that they celebrated the first thanksgiving in the late 1600s.  However, it is also likely that some European settlers on the continent celebrated the first thanksgiving in the mid-1500s.  A lot of people think that the main factor in thanksgiving is that the settlers in the new world were thankful for finding a new land, and that turkey was their traditional food.  Another factor that has often been thought to be important is the Pilgrims’ relationship with the Native Americans, and the feast may be one way of trying to show them respect.  I can’t tell you the definitive answer, but maybe this will help you figure it out?"}

{"chosen": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about wild dogs? Not stray dogs, but wild dogs.\n\nAssistant: I know a lot about wild dogs. Would you like to read about what a wolf is, or about coyotes? I know they’re both kind of similar to the dogs that roam the streets, but they’re more closely related to domesticated dogs than to the street dogs.\n\nHuman: Oh, I would love to learn about wolves.\n\nAssistant: Sure! Here’s some fun facts: A wolf is a large canine, and it’s typically found in cold climates. The most popular type of wolf is the gray wolf. Wolves are able to smell things about 6 kilometers away, and their sense of hearing can even detect sounds below 30 Hz, which is really low. They have acute eyesight, and can be taught to follow a ball with their eyes, and even read. They can be trained to do many tasks, and may even be trained to deliver newspapers. They’re very social animals, and make excellent pets.", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about wild dogs? Not stray dogs, but wild dogs.\n\nAssistant: I know a lot about wild dogs.
